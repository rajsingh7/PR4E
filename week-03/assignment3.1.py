#3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay.
#Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
#Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
#You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
#Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.

inp = raw_input("Enter Hours: ")
hours = float(inp)
inp = raw_input("Enter Rate: ")
rate = float(inp)
#print rate, hours

if hours <= 40 :
    pay = rate * hours
else :
    pay = rate * 40 + (rate * 1.5 * (hours -40))
print pay
